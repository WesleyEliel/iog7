You are going to check us out. We don't want it to be profitable for you. But we want to keep it free.
We will publish here the correct scores for some matches. But they will be encrypted. The info is published before the match. You save the text, but you can't see the result.
After the match is finished, we will add here the secret key to decrypt and check the correct score. It is free and non-profitable. Brilliant.
We use The Decryptor. The link: thedecryptor.com

We publish only Wednesdays matches. There are last ~25 matches (all by Wednesdays). So please don't ask us why we don't publish every match here
